# Automatic Water Level Controller
## Abstract
Automatic water level controllers are a product that was created to automatically control a motor, which helps to ensure a constant reserve of water in a storage tank. These automatic water level controllers are used to automatically fill the over-head tank.

A water level controller senses the level of water in a tank and drives the water pump. Water level controllers switch the motor on whenever the water level drops below a certain level and shuts the motor off when the water rises well above a fixed level. This circuit which will detect the water level and will blink a red or green colour upon getting the water tank full or a preset level.

## Requirements :
### High Level Requirements

|ID	    |DESCRIPTION
|:------|:-------------
|HLR01	|Servo motor should be ON/OFF at desired level.
|HLR02	|Ultrasonic Sensor should sense the level of water in tank.
|HLR03	|LED should glow RED/GREEN.
|HLR04	|Voltmeter should measure the voltage.

### Low Level Requirements
|ID	    |Description                                               |HLR ID
|:------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:----
|LLR01	|Servo motor valve should be opened when the water is less.|HLR01
|LLR02	|Servo motor valve should be closed when water is full.    |HLR01
|LLR03	|LED should glow Red when valve is open.                   |HLR03
|LLR04	|LED should glow green when valve is closed.               |HLR03
|LLR05	|Potentiometer should regulate the voltage properly.       |HLR04

 ### STRENGTHS
* Easy to install, manage and maintain and low maintenance.
* Highly reliable and Economically competitive.
* Enhanced Security of Urban Water supply and Water use efficiency.
 
 ### WEAKNESSES
* The automatic water level controller shows poor durability.
* When a problem arose, there is no built-in function to help identify the source of the
failure.
* Water level controls need to be replaced every 3 years.

 ### OPPORTUNITIES
* It Develops Water Saving Technology.
* Maximize Water supply Benefits and provide balanced allocation of water resources.


 ### THREATS
* Skills for repair/spare parts not available in most of the areas.
* Any sort of defect or fault in the circuit will cause problem in water supply. 


## 4 W's and 1H's
 ### Who :
 * Everyone can use this device as for their commercial, industrial or domestic use.
 ### What :
 * This system is Automatic so it doesn't requires manual work which saves human time and energy.
 ### When :
 * This system is used when the water tank level is empty or full.
 ### Where :
 * In water supply system , Agricultural Use and also in Use for Hydropower Generation.
 ### How :
 * Automatic water level controllers switch the motor on whenever the water level drops below a certain level and shuts the motor off when the water rises well above a fixed level.
 


# Applications :
* It is used in Pump controller and can be used in water tanks to control water levels.
* It is used in Irrigation control as it automatically turn ON/OFF pumps.
* It can be used in factories, commercial complexes, apartments, home.
* It can be used in Oil tank Level Control.
* It can also be used in Sewage pump level control.
