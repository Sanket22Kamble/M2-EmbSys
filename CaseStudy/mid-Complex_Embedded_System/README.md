# Components :

## Mechanical Keypad :
* Mechanical Keypad is used to give input instruction from users to Vacuum Cleaner such as suction pressure, speed , timer , automatic on/off modes.

## EEPROM :
* EEPROM is user-modifiable read-only memory (ROM) that allow users to erase and reprogram stored data repeatedly in Vaccum Cleaner.

## Main Switch :
* The main switch provides a high speed/low speed switch and a power switch.  The power switch is automatically moved to its open or OFF position in response to the mounting of an accessory.
* The control switch and motor provide plug-type connectors which automatically connect the internal motor wiring when the switch is installed.

## Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) :
* An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to convert an analog signal such as voltage to a digital form so that it can be read and processed by a microcontroller.

## Relay :
* An Vacuum Cleaner uses relays to switch the system's high-voltage parts on and off.


## Backlight :
* A backlight is a form of illumination used in LCD. Backlights are used in small displays to increase readability in low light conditions such as in Vacuum Cleaner to produce light in a manner similar to a CRT display.

## LCD :
* The vacuum cleaner also has an LCD Digital Display that provides all the information including your suction level settings and remaining battery time at a glance. 

## Buffer :
* When the buffer is in operation, a vacuum force starts water flowing through a hose; as it enters the combustion chamber of the engine, it cools the engine in the form of a mist that turns to steam when it encounters the engine's high temperatures.

## Temperature sensor :
* It is used to detect temperature of system .

## Buzzer :
* The use of Buzzer in vaccum cleaner is to give warning to user to turn off switch if system detects any fault.

## Signal Conditioning and Comparators :
* The main function of a signal conditioner & Comparator is to pick up the signal and convert it into a higher level of electrical signal.

## Gate driver :
* A gate driver is a power amplifier that accepts a low power input from a controller and produces the appropriate high current gate drive for a power device.

## BLDC motor :
* BLDC motor spins a fan, sucking in air and any small particles caught up in it and pushing it out the other side, into a bag to create the negative pressure.

# Requirements

# Applications :
* They are majorly used to remove dirt and dust from  carpets, velveteen furniture and floors.
* Vacuum cleaner Captures Excess Pet Hair ,Trap Dust Before It Spreads,Clean Kitchen Appliances.
* Use the vacuum cleaner to remove dust from the refrigerator coils and condenser. 
* Vacuum Cleaner helps you to get small items, if you dropped something small like an earring, nail, or screw behind a piece of furniture.
